connect every cable.
check that you have both diodes the right way.
turn on power. 12 volt on both inputs.(if trouble adjusting the voltage up. try turning the current up first, then the voltage often will go up)
turn on motor box
pull main (or the commit ALT FUNGERER if not working)
build node1 and node2
if getting a black screen take out the power cables to the board and set them in again. then press the reset button
if servo is going the wrong way comment/unncomment the inverter in pwm_update_duty_cycle in node 2
if pid is bad on the board you are using; tune the parameter in driver_PID in node 2

after following this checklist everything will work. (but be careful about touching the cabels for the ir diode. can make you lose the game before you shoudl)
